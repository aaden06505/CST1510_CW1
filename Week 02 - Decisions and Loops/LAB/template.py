# ==================================================================== INPUT
# 1. Ask for your three values.
#
#    - the first is TEXT      (a name, a hostname, an IP)  -> no conversion needed
#    - the second is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())
#    - the third  is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())

while True:
    label = input("Enter hostname: ")   
    if label.lower() == "quit":

    value =  float(input("Enter GB used: "))
    limit =  float(input("Enter GB limit: "))
    if limit<=0:
        print("Limit must be greater than 0. Please try again.")
        continue

    # ================================================================== PROCESS
    # 2. Work out the difference and the percentage.       [Typical and above]
    difference = value - limit
    percent = (value / limit) * 100

    # 3. Decide a status and store it in a variable called status.
    #
    #    Threshold : if / else        -> "OVER LIMIT" or "OK"
    #    Typical   : if / elif / else -> "OVER LIMIT" (100% or more),
    #                                     "WARNING" (90% or more), otherwise "OK"

    if percent >= 100:
        status = "OVER LIMIT"
    elif percent >= 90:
        status = "WARNING"
    else:
        status = "OK"


# =================================================================== OUTPUT
# 4. Print the report.
#
#    Threshold : the three values you were given, plus status, inside a border
#    Typical   : add difference and percent, 2 decimal places, right-aligned
#    Excellent : wrap sections 1-4 in a loop so you can check as many records
#                as you like in one run - type "quit" as the label to stop.
#                Keep count of how many came back OVER LIMIT and print that
#                once, after the loop ends.

# ==========================================================================
# 5. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it three times with different numbers
#    [ ] Run it with a total of 0 and note the error (do not fix it yet)
#    [ ] Check every variable name says what it holds
